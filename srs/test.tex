	\section*{Case 1:}

	Title: Access Home Page – Accesing Successfully on Devops Monitoring Home Page
	\newline
	Description: A registered user should be able to successfully access the Devops Monitoring.
	\newline
	Precondition: zabbix server should be up and running.
	\newline
	Assumption: having internet connection and  supported browser.
	\newline
	\newline
	Test Steps:
	\begin{itemize}
\item[1.] Navigate to any browser that you can gain access.
\item[2.]In the address bar write the address of the localhost. 
\item[3.]Click the ‘Enter’ button.
	\end{itemize}
	Expected Result: Devops Home Page opens:

\section*{Case 2:}
 	
		Title: Monitoring Programs In A Host  – Monitoring Executable Programs Which Are  Deployed  In A Host.
	\newline
	Description: A devops user should be able to successfully monitor all programs in a host.
	\newline
	Precondition: zabbix server should be up and running.
	\newline
	Assumption: Having internet connection, connetted to Monitoring home page and running Zabbix server.
	\newline
	\newline
	Test Steps:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item[1.] 	Click the “Details” button on the right side of the page for each host to see applications installed in it.
		\item[2.]	Click “GRAPH PAGE” button to view graphs of all the applications in a scpecific host.
		
	\end{itemize}
	Expected Result: DevOps users see links of all graphs in a host.

	Title: Monitoring Program’s CPU Usage  – Monitoring CPU usage of An Executable Program Which Is Deployed To Hosts.
		\newline
	Description: A devops user should be able to successfully monitor CPU usage of a program in every host it is deployed.
	\newline
	Precondition: Zabbix server should be up and running.
	\newline
	Assumption:  If a program is installed in at least one host, having Internet connection, connected to Monitoring home page and running Zabbix server.
	\newline
	\newline
	Test Steps:

	\section*{Case 4:}
	Title: Monitoring Program’s Memory Usage  – Monitoring Memory Usage Of An Executable Program Which Is Deployed To Hosts.
	\newline
	Description: A devops user should be able to successfully monitor memory usage of a program in  host which he/she want to monitor.
	\newline
	Precondition: Zabbix server should be up and running.
	\newline
	Assumption:  If a program is installed in at least one host, having internet connection, connected to Monitoring home page and running Zabbix server.
	\newline
	\newline
	Test Steps:
	\begin{itemize}
	
	
	\item[1.]Click the “Details” button on the left side of the page for each program.
	\item[2.]Click the “MEMORY USAGE” button that you want to view.
	\end{itemize}
	Expected Result: DevOps users can see graph information of memory usage of an application in a specific host.
